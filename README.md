# Richelieu

Rust-based implementation of the drunken bishop algorithm for fingerprint visualization

## Getting started

Run `cargo run -- --data INSERT_YOUR_TEXT_HERE` (inserting your text there) to try it out.

## TODO

- Ensure this works larger or more complex messages. Compare against <https://www.jfurness.uk/the-drunken-bishop-algorithm/>
- If we include hashing, we can print the hash algo at the top of the output frame.
- A fun variant might be a "wrap-around" board that avoids clipping to the edges.
